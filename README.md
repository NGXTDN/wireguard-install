## wireguard-install
WireGuard [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.

## my Blog is [vimetc.me](https://vimetc.me/)

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used WireGuard before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/JfGpt -O wireguard-install.sh && bash wireguard-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall WireGuard.

### I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
You can get a VPS from just $1/month at [VirMach](https://virmarch.com).
